  <meta property="og:description" content="Recently I started to learn how to use d3.js, a JavaScript library for interactive data-driven visualizations.

These values are obtained by following all possible paths from the specified node to the bottom: The colors of the edges stand for the different factors $h_0$, these factors of each path are multiplied, and the products arising from the paths are summed together.

<h2 id="the-dilation-and-wavelet-equation">The Dilation and Wavelet Equation</h2>

<p>In the Fast Wavelet Transform, the wavelets scaling function is defined by the dilation equation:</p>

\[\phi(t) = \sum\limits_k h_0(k) \phi(2t-k)\]

<p>This shows the fractal self-similarity of the scaling function: We can construct it from scaled and shifted versions of itself that are summed together. In a similar way, we can construct the wavelet function from the scaling function using the wavelet equation:</p>

\[\psi(t) = \sum\limits_k h_1(k) \phi(2t-k)\]

\[x_{n+1}(t) = \sum\limits_k h_0(k) x_n(t - 2^{-n-1}k)\]

<p>The second graph shows several steps of the cascading algorithm, using the dilation equation:</p>

\[\phi_{n+1}(t) = \sum\limits_k h_0(k) \phi_n(2t - k)\]
