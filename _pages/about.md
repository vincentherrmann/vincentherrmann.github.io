I am a PhD candidate at the Swiss AI Lab IDSIA, University of Lugano, working under the supervision of Prof. JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber. 
My research focuses on artificial curiosity, representation learning, reinforcement learning, and information theory. 
My goal is to discover criteria for identifying the interestingness of objects and to develop effective representations for them. 
I am also a classical pianist and composer.
